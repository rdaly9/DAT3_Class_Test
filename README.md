The twitterverse can be a battlefield and from time to time, we shine a light on the nasty things people post about celebrities by having those celebrities read them aloud. Weâ€™ve done it again in our 9th edition of Mean Tweets featuring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Sean Penn, Liv Tyler, Elizabeth Banks, Daniel Radcliffe, Kirsten Dunst, Jason Schwartzman, Michael B Jordan, Key and Peele, Julianna Margulies, Colin Farrell, Jordana Brewster, Kurt Russell, Viola Davis, Matthew Perry, Lake Bell and Sarah Paulson.
